# lera_DPd

This package is the Public version of the HFR_DP software for processing LERA-type HF radar data sets.

This package contains the master programs to process LERA-type HF Radar system data in Matlab from the decimated time series data (a *.mat file pre-divided into chirps) to radial velocities averaged over an azimuthal window for a particular radar site.  This code allows for the use of MKII or MKIII radar systems and direction finding methods including; MUSIC, MLE, and WSF. 

See HFR_DP_LERA_SETUP_README.m for setup and package details.
