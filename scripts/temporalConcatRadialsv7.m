function TT = temporalConcatRadialsv7( T, DR, DB, DH, DD )
% TEMPORALCONCATRADIALS  Concatenate timesteps in a RADIAL structure
%
% Usage: RADIAL = temporalConcatRadials( RADIAL, deltaRange, ...
%                              deltaBear, deltaHead, deltaDist )
%
% This function will take a RADIAL structure array, possibly containing data
% from multiple sites and multiple timesteps at each site, and concatenate
% them along the time direction.  Data from each site will be concatenated
% separately.  The final RADIAL structure array will have only as many
% elements as the number of sites represented by the input RADIAL structure
% array.  As radial grids at a site sometimes have small differences, this
% function allows for some slop in the radial positions, angles and ranges
% (see discussion below).  The list of sites in the original RADIAL
% structure array will be based exclusively on the SiteName inside the
% RADIAL structures.  The output RADIAL structure array will have the
% sites in alphabetical order.  This may be different than the original
% order of the sites!
%
% Inputs
% ------
% RADIAL = RADIAL structure array to be concatenated.
% deltaRange = slop in range below which two radial grid points are to
%          be considered the same.  Defaults to eps.
% deltaBear = slop in bearing below which two radial grid points are to
%             be considered the same.  Defaults to eps.
% deltaHead = slop in heading below which two radial grid points are to
%             be considered the same.  Defaults to eps.
% deltaDist = spatial separation below which two radial grid points are to
%             be considered the same.  Defaults to eps.
%
% Output
% ------
% RADIAL = radial structure that is concatenation of input RADIAL structures.
%
%
%
% Concatenating of multiple radial timesteps is typically complex.  This is
% because radial grids often change from one timestep to the next.  This
% function tries to deal with this in a consistent way.  It begins with the
% first radial structure at a site.  It then looks for grid points, ranges
% and directions in the next radial structure from that site that are
% identical to the first and concatenates these.  It then looks for grid
% points that are within deltaRange, deltaBear, deltaHead AND deltaD of
% existing grid points in the (growing) concatenated radial structure and
% concatenates this data (note that grid points must satisfy all
% conditions).  Whatever is left is assumed to be a new radial grid point at
% that site not in previous radial structures and these are added as such to
% the end of the growing new radial structure.  All missing data is filled
% with NaN.
%
% NOTE: Concatenation will only be attempted on LonLat, RangeBearHead, U, V,
% RadComp, Error, Flag, TimeStamp and FileName. All other elements of the
% structure will contain information from the first structure array from
% that site, with the exception of OtherMatrixVars, which will be left
% empty.
