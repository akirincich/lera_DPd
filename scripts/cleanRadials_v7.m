function [R,I] = cleanRadials_v7(R,maxspd)
% CLEANRADIALS  Remove radial current measurements exceeding a speed threshold
%
% Usage: [RADIALclean,I] = cleanTotals(RADIALorig,maxspd)
%
% Bad radial current measurements will be replaced with NaN.
%
% Inputs
% ------
% RADIALorig = a RADIAL structure to be cleaned.  Can be an array of
%              radial structures.
% maxspd = a maximum radial speed cutoff.  It can also be a double array
%          of the same size as RADIALorig.
%
% Outputs
% -------
% RADIALclean = Cleaned RADIAL structure
% I = Index of data points that were removed.  This will have a zero for
%     good data, a 1 for data whose speed is above maxspd.  If RADIALorig
%     was an array of radial structures, then this will be a cell array
%     with one element for each element of RADIALorig.
